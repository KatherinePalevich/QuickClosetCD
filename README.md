QuickCloset is an iOS application I wrote for a Independent Studies Computer Science class. I have a passion for fashion, yearning for learning, and 
wanted to combine these with my love for programming.

QuickCloset is the answer to all your closet organization needs. Simply download the app and add your clothing to the virtual closet, 
assigning tags to each item like Summer, Casual, and Yellow. Then, move to the Outfit Generator tab where you will fill out the questionnaire 
and then see QuickCloset do what it does best: generating outfits! Scrolling horizontally, you will be able to view as many unique outfits as 
there are different appropriate tops. Screenshot to save an outfit combination or have fun seeing all the amazing ways to wear your favorite clothing.
